# What can you find here?

Here you can find Matrix calculator.

## What can it do?
* It implements some common operations with matrixes, like addition,
  multiplying etc. 
* Matrix can be created with template class elements, for example, 
  there is class with Rational numbers wth implemented arithmetical
  operations.
* For square matrixes getting trace, determinant and inverting methods
  are implemented. For calculating inverted matrix Gauss method was
  used, so complexity of finding determinant or inverted matrix is
  cubic.
* Also there implemented lots of operators, like reading from istream 
  and writing to ostream, or all arithmetcal operators, so it is easy 
  to start using these classes in some more complex projects.
